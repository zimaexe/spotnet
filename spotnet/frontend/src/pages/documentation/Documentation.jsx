Today, money markets facilitate an estimated $3.2 trillion in daily transactions in the global financial system, making them critical for short-term funding needs. In the context of DeFi, money markets play an essential role in activities such as lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision. At zkLend, our goal is to create a simple, secure, and efficient platform for your liquidity needs. We've built a permissionless lending market where anyone can deposit and borrow digital assets directly from their wallets, at any time. When you deposit assets, you earn interest from borrowers using your funds. You can also use your deposited assets as collateral to borrow other digital assets.",
